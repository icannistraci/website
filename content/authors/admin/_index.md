I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Sapienza University of Rome in the VisionLab research group.
My research interests are widespread, focusing on **deep learning**, ranging from time-series to image analysis, especially in **healthcare**.

I strongly believe in multidisciplinary **collaborations** to merge bits of knowledge. I love using computer science technologies to understand peopleâ€™s needs better and apply computer science to **improve their lives**.

I am also involved in **educational activities** to disseminate coding and digital skills to students, particularly young women.

In my free time, I enjoy being involved in different sports such as weightlifting, mountain biking, climbing, and hiking. I also like reading, traveling, meeting new people, and listening to their life stories.
